# test-3

## Overview

This repository is a small example/test project used to verify GitHub development workflows: branching, committing, opening pull requests, and tracking work through issues. It intentionally has a minimal codebase so that changes here are easy to review and safe to experiment with.

## Installation

This repository has no build tooling or external dependencies.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mehulagarwal13/test-3.git
cd test-3
```

No package installation step is required to read or edit the documentation in this repository.

## Running Locally

This repository does not yet contain an application entry point. "Working locally" currently means:

1. Open the repository in your editor of choice.
2. Edit `README.md`, or add new files under a clearly named directory (e.g. `docs/`, `tests/`).
3. Commit your changes on a feature branch and open a pull request for review.

As real application code is added, update this section with the actual run command.

## Repository Structure

```text
test-3/
├── README.md               # Project documentation (this file)
├── CONTRIBUTING.md         # How to contribute
├── CHANGELOG.md            # Notable changes
└── tests/
    └── validate_repo.py    # Lightweight documentation sanity check
```

## Usage Example

The most common "usage" of a documentation-only repository is contributing an update:

```bash
git checkout -b docs/my-update
# edit README.md
git add README.md
git commit -m "docs: describe my update"
git push origin docs/my-update
```

Then open a pull request describing the change.

## Contributing

See [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](CONTRIBUTING.md) for the full contributor guide (reporting issues, branch/commit conventions, the PR checklist, and the review process). Notable changes are tracked in [`CHANGELOG.md`](CHANGELOG.md).

## Testing

A lightweight validation script lives at `tests/validate_repo.py`. It checks that core documentation files exist and are non-empty -- a minimal sanity check appropriate for a documentation-focused repository.

```bash
python tests/validate_repo.py
```
